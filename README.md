## About

This is implementation of Boustrophedon Decompotion algorithm. 
It includes separated utility library and a demo with sample usage.
______

## Structure:
 
* BCD/  - Boustrophedon Decomposition Algorithm Implementation
* LeoLibs/ - utility class implementing ReebGraph
* demo/ - contains and example use of BCD

______
## Required Packages

- Opencv 4.5.x 
- Boost 1.65 [sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev]
- QT 5 [https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu] or sudo apt-get install qt5-default
 If Qt is not in default package then specify CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/where/qt5/lives
______
